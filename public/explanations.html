    <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
    <p>Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.</p>

    <h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
    <p>Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple implementation</li>
      <li>Efficient for (quite) small data sets</li>
      <li>More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort</li>
      <li>Adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is O(n + d), where d is the number of inversions</li>
      <li>Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys</li>
      <li>In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space</li>
      <li>Online; i.e., can sort a list as it receives it</li>
    </ul>
